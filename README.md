# High-Speed Rail Communication: Transmission Line Applications in Onboard Internet Systems
# How Transmission Lines Power High-Speed Rail Internet

# 1. Introduction:
As high-speed trains like India’s Vande Bharat Express and Japan's Shinkansen race across the country at speeds of over 300 km/h, passengers expect uninterrupted Wi-Fi and real-time updates.
But transmitting stable signals at these speeds poses challenges like signal reflection, impedance mismatch, and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Transmission line theory plays a critical role in ensuring smooth data flow in these harsh environments.

# 🏗️ 2. System Overview: Onboard Communication Network:

Components involved:

Train-mounted antenna (receives 4G/5G satellite/infrastructure signals)
Router + RF modem in control cabin
Internal Wi-Fi system in coaches
Power amplifiers, bandpass filters, and RF splitters
The RF sections use coaxial cables, microstrip lines, and waveguides, all governed by transmission line principles.

💡 Real-time use: The train’s rooftop antenna must be impedance matched with the coaxial feed line. Otherwise, reflected signals reduce data quality and affect real-time services like ticket verification, alerts, and entertainment.
